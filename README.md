PYTHON-CHALLENGE-1
In the code for PYBANK and PYPOLL I submitted the following codes and achieved these results:

The total number of months included in the dataset: my code generated - 86
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period: my code generated - 22564198
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period Aug - 16 (1862002)
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period Feb - 14 (1825558)
The next challenge will be to help modernize the voting process in a small, rural town. Given a data set called election_data.csv. Three columns are included in the dataset: "Voters' ID", "County" and "Candidate". The job is to compile a Python script that analyses the votes and computes each of the following values.
The total number of votes cast: my code calculated the result of 369711
A complete list of candidates who received votes: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doane
The percentage of votes each candidate won: Stockham (85231) 23.049 percent
The total number of votes each candidate won: DeGette (2782892) 73.812 percent
The winner of the election based on popular vote: Doane (11606) 3.139 percent
